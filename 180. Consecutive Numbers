Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

Brute Force Approach would be self join
solution 1
select distinct l1.num from logs l1,logs l2,logs l3
where l1.id = l2.id+1 and l2.Id=l3.Id+1
and l1.Num=l2.Num and l2.Num=l3.Num

solution 2
using Analytical Function
with cte as (
select
    num,
    LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) as prevRw,
    LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) as nextRw
from logs)

select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
from cte
where num = prevRw and num = nextRw

solution 3
with cte as (select
num,
cast(id as SIGNED) - cast(row_number() over (partition by num order by id) as SIGNED) as conSecutiveGrp
from 
logs )

select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
from cte
group by num, conSecutiveGrp
having count(conSecutiveGrp) >= 3

Solution 3 will work for more than 3 consecutive numbers
