+---------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed due to being reported or as a result of an admin review.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+
Output: 
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
Explanation: 
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts were removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        action_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT R.post_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT A.post_id) *100 AS cnt
    FROM Actions A
    LEFT JOIN Removals R
        ON A.post_id = R.post_id
    WHERE action = 'report' AND extra = 'spam'
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(cnt),2) AS average_daily_percent
FROM CTE
