Write an SQL query that reports the most experienced employees in each project. In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 3                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | employee_id   |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 1           | 3             |
| 2           | 1             |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience



with cte as (
select p.project_id,
p.employee_id,
dense_rank() over (partition by p.project_id order by experience_years desc) as rnk
from project p inner join employee e on p.employee_id = e.employee_id)

select project_id,
employee_id 
from cte
where rnk = 1.
