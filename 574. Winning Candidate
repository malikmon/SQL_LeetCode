| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id and the name of a candidate.
 

Table: Vote

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| candidateId | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is an auto-increment primary key.
candidateId is a foreign key to id from the Candidate table.
Each row of this table determines the candidate who got the ith vote in the elections.
 

Write an SQL query to report the name of the winning candidate (i.e., the candidate who got the largest number of votes).

The test cases are generated so that exactly one candidate wins the elections.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Candidate table:
+----+------+
| id | name |
+----+------+
| 1  | A    |
| 2  | B    |
| 3  | C    |
| 4  | D    |
| 5  | E    |
+----+------+
Vote table:
+----+-------------+
| id | candidateId |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | 2           |
| 2  | 4           |
| 3  | 3           |
| 4  | 2           |
| 5  | 5           |
+----+-------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| B    |
+------+
Explanation: 
Candidate B has 2 votes. Candidates C, D, and E have 1 vote each.
The winner is candidate B.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
# with cte as (select 
# count(*) as numVotes,
# c.name as name
# from
# Candidate c, Vote v
# where c.id = v.candidateId
# group by c.id)

# select name
# from cte
# where numVotes = (select max(numVotes) from cte)

with  candidateVoteCnt AS (
    select
    count(id) as totVotes,
    candidateId
    from vote
    group by candidateId
)

select c.name 
from 
candidate c inner join candidateVoteCnt v on 
c.id = v.candidateId
where totVotes = (
select max(totVotes) from candidateVoteCnt )
