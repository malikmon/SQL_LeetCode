Table: Events

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occurred at some business for a number of times.
 

The average activity for a particular event_type is the average occurences across all companies that have this event.

An active business is a business that has more than one event_type such that their occurences is strictly greater than the average activity for that event.

Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Events table:
+-------------+------------+------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurences |
+-------------+------------+------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7          |
| 3           | reviews    | 3          |
| 1           | ads        | 11         |
| 2           | ads        | 7          |
| 3           | ads        | 6          |
| 1           | page views | 3          |
| 2           | page views | 12         |
+-------------+------------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
Explanation:  
The average activity for each event can be calculated as follows:
- 'reviews': (7+3)/2 = 5
- 'ads': (11+7+6)/3 = 8
- 'page views': (3+12)/2 = 7.5
The business with id=1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8), so it is an active business.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
with cte as (
    select
    business_id,
    event_type,
    occurences,
    avg(occurences) over (partition by event_type order by event_type) as avg_activity_event
    from Events)

select business_id from cte
where occurences > avg_activity_event
group by business_id
having count(event_type) > 1
